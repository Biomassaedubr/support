ZenHub Support
==========

Welcome to our public-facing ZenHub repo. Here you can submit issues, vote on feature requests, or just say hi!

# What is Zenhub?
ZenHub is a lightweight browser extension that injects features directly into GitHub's native interface. It adds a key, strategic dimension to GitHub allowing dynamic peer feedback, file uploads, customizable kanban-style Issue boards, and more.

Learn about our features on [our website](https://www.zenhub.io/)!
