**ZenHub is how the world's best development teams work together.** üéà 

As the only project management tool integrated natively in GitHub‚Äôs UI, ZenHub helps you stay in your workflow without distractions. There are no new queues to check, entries to update, or priorities to manage outside GitHub. 

Because ZenHub‚Äôs features are powered by native GitHub issues, it doesn‚Äôt create more process ‚Äì it gets out of your way so you can focus on shipping awesome products.

Download the ZenHub extension for Firefox or Chrome [here](http://www.zenhub.com). It‚Äôs free for public, academic, and personal repositories. It's also free for teams under six on unlimited private repositories!

## Features

### Task boards with multi-repo support

**Flexible Boards** enable teams to visualize entire projects without leaving GitHub. Whether you prefer kanban, agile, or your own flavor of workflow, ZenHub supports it all. You can also connect task boards for projects that span several repos or even organizations. 

### Epics inside Github

By adding a crucial ‚Äúextra layer‚Äù of hierarchy to your issues, Epics make it easy to build, execute, and maintain a healthy product backlog. 

### Slack Integration
Our **Slack Integration** keeps you updated on key project activity across any device. Track issue progress, estimates, Task Board updates, and more.

### Burndown Charts & Issue Estimates

Assign time or **complexity estimates** to issues, then track your progress using Milestone-integrated Burndown Charts. 

### Private task management

Add any issue or pull request as a personal task, then organize your *private to-do lists* by day, project, or something totally unique.

## Submitting issues 

We use ZenHub to help make this process easy.  Visit our task board (press `b` with ZenHub installed) to see current issues, organized as:

### 1 - Inbox (to be reviewed)

The first pipeline a new issue will hit. This lets us know what needs our attention.

### 2 - Discussion

An issue will get moved here when we are looking for some community feedback, so don't forget to add GitHub reactions to those issues you would like to see! Bug reports or issues awaiting replies will also be moved to discussion to keep the inbox clear.

### 3 - Community Backlog

Features that the ZenHub team are working on, or will be in the future.

### 4 - Known Issues

Issues we know about and are working to resolve.

### 4 - Priorities

Features/feedback we are actively looking into that align with our roadmap and future milestones.

### 5 - Up Next 

The next few big issues that are in the pipeline.

### 6 - In Progress

What we are currently working on. 

---

### 7 - Pipelines that will be phased out

- Community backlog
- Community Icebox

We're working to increase the visibility of what we're up to here at ZenHub. We'll be moving issues from these two pipelines into their appropriate new home, Discussion/Priorities/Up Next/In Progress.

Help avoid duplicates by checking the board first to see if someone else is already talking about it before submitting an issue.
