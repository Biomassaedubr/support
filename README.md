# ZenHub Support

Welcome to our public ZenHub repo. Here you can submit issues, vote on feature requests, or just say hi!

# What is Zenhub?
ZenHub is how the world's best development teams work together. 

As the only project management tool integrated natively in GitHub, ZenHub's lightweight extension adds a collection of collaboration-enhancing features – like Task Boards, a reporting suite, personal task management, and more – directly into GitHub’s UI, creating a single source of truth for the entire company.
